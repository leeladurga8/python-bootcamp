python divides the operators as the following:
a. Arthimetic operator
b. Logical operator
c. Assignment operator
d. Comparision operator
e. Identity operator
f. Membership operator
g. Bitwise operator
a.Arthimetic operator:  IN this operator we have addition(x+y), subtraction(x-y),multiplication(x*y),Division(x/y),modulus(x%y),exponentiation(x**y),
floor division(x//y).
b.Logical operator: In this operator we have logical and ,logical or,logical not .
logical and :it returns true if both statements are true ,ex: x<5 and y<15.
logical or : it returns true if one of the statements is true. x=5 0r x>8.
logical not : it returns false if statements is true not(x<5 and y<10).
c. Assignment operator:It is used to assign values to variables.
In this operator we have =  a = 6;
a+=7 => a = a+7; 
a-= =>a = a-8; 
a*=7 => a = a*7 ;
a/=5 => a = a/5 ;
a%= => a = a % 5  ; 
a **= 3 => a = a **3
d. comparision operator:
