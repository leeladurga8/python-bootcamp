Python is an intrepreted general-purpose or multipurpose high-level programming language.
Python uses intrepreted as a translator used to convert to bytecode line by line
Translator used to take the source code as a input which humans can understand and converts to 
machine code.
Dynamically typed language : suppose if we want to declare a variable with datatype ,this datatype 
can be declare at run time so we called dunamic typed language.
Variable :variables are containers for storing data values like numbers and characters.
TypeConversion: Converting one data type to another data type
there are two types of typeconversion
1.implicit type conversion
2.Explicit type conversion
In implicit type conversion automatically converts one data type to another data type without any user
involvement.
x=10
x is of type:<class 'int'>
y= 10.6
y is of type : <class 'float'>
In explicit type conversion datatype is manually changed by the user as  per their requirements
int a =(int)3.89f
Why indexing starts with zero?
The more efficient for the computer that an array starts at zero,because computer looks at an array it 
reads memoryaddress of first element and calculates the rest of the  address by adding the size of 
each element and along with previous element.suppose first element is at 100 with 4 bytes next 
address will be  at 104 ,108 and so on....it is very efficient to start at zero.
what is Static array and Dynamic array?
In python ,lets know about the static array and dynamic array ,is very important to know about the 
allocation of memoryworking.
Static array: A static array is allocated at compile time with a fixed size once its updated 
it cannot alter the size.
a_static=[1, 2, 3 ,4]
 size is 4 fixed, cannot be changed.
Dynamic array:Dynamic array is allocated in run time can be altered the size at run time means we 
can change at program execution.
a_dynamic = [0]*5
