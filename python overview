Python is an intrepreted general-purpose or multipurpose high-level programming language.
Python uses intrepreted as a translator used to convert to bytecode line by line
Translator used to take the source code as a input which humans can understand and converts to 
machine code.
Dynamically typed language : suppose if we want to declare a variable with datatype ,this datatype 
can be declare at run time so we called dunamic typed language.
Variable :variables are containers for storing data values like numbers and characters.
TypeConversion: Converting one data type to another data type
there are two types of typeconversion
1.implicit type conversion
2.Explicit type conversion
In implicit type conversion automatically converts one data type to another data type without any user
involvement.
x=10
x is of type:<class 'int'>
y= 10.6
y is of type : <class 'float'>
In explicit type conversion datatype is manually changed by the user as  per their requirements
int a =(int)3.89f
